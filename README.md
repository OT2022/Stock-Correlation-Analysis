# Stock-Correlation-Analysis
Example Stock Correlation Analysis script to calculate a stock's correlation to its respective market index over a specific time period.

Very basic script but the idea is that you can use it to enter a ticker and market index for a specific time period (by updating the start_date and end_date variable) to pull the daily returns for the stock and market index. The correlation is then calculated using Pearson Correlation coefficient. The daily price returns are downloaded using yahoo finance.
